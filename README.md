React Pomodoro timer FCC project

The Pomodoro Technique is a late 1980's time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. You can read more about this on its [dedicated Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## Underlying Principles:

_There are six steps in the original technique:_

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

### Boost your productivity

This timer is still being created, but will go live [here](https://marcusmichaels.github.io/pomodoro) when built.
